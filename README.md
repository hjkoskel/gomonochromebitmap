# gomonochromebitmap
Golang library for monochrome image operations

I developed this library for my personal "retrocomputing"/emulator project. 
This library is only for black-white images.

At the moment some basic functions are implemented in very naive way. I just need this library for getting things running
I will provide more optimized versions after I complete my other project using this library.
