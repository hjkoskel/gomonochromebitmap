# gomonochromebitmap
Golang library for monochrome image operations

I developed this library for my "retrocomputing"/emulator projects. 
This library is only for black-white images

This repository is going to include operations like

-Converting (RGBA) image to monochrome with threshold
-Bresenham's Line / Circle algorithm
-Drawing sprites
-Small pixel font rendering (line wrap options etc...)

Codes are released soon
